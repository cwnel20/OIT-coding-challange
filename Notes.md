# OIT-coding-challange
I did not have a lot of options for terminals to make the code so I used an online python terminal called onecomplier.com I've provided a link to the sites Python compiler. One thing though is that they have a filter set up where XXX is displayed as a string of asterisks like this *****.

What I did was just break down all the numeral values into thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones values respectivly, then had the code return the corresponding string of numerals or numbers in a line. I wasn't sure how to make so you didn't have to add an input for every variable, and I didn't have a ton of time to figure it out so you just have to add a 0 input for the variables that don't need a number or letter. This is an example of what the inputs should look like:

MMM

CD

XX

II

3

4

2

2

With this input the output would look like this:

Numerals to Numbers:
3 4 2 1

Numbers to Numerals:
MMM CD XX I

It took me a little over two hours to complete two hours.
