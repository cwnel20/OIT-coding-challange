# OIT-coding-challange
I did not have a lot of options for terminals to make the code so I used an online python terminal called onecomplier.com

I didn't have any notes to be entirly honest, I just kinda used simple if else statements to make it work.

It took me about an hour and a half I believe.

I wasn't sure how to make so you didn't have to add an input for every variable, and I didn't have a ton of time to figure it out so you just have to add a 0 input for the variables that don't need a number or letter.
